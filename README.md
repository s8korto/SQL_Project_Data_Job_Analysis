# Introduction
Welcome to my SQL Portfolio Project, where I delve into the data job market with a focus on data science roles. This project is a personal exploration into identifying the top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and the intersection of high demand with high salary in the field of data analytics.

Check out my SQL queries here: [project_sql](https://github.com/s8korto/SQL_Project_Data_Job_Analysis/tree/main/project_sql).

# Background
The motivation behind this project stemmed from my desire to understand the data science job market better. I aimed to discover which skills are paid the most and in demand, making my job search more targeted and effective. 

The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
   
# Tools I Used
In this project, I utilized a variety of tools to conduct my analysis:

- **SQL** (Structured Query Language): Enabled me to interact with the database, extract insights, and answer my key questions through queries.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database management system, PostgreSQL allowed me to store, query, and manipulate the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** This open-source administration and development platform helped me manage the database and execute SQL queries.
